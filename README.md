At the moment just finds the nearest delivery points for the given zipcode and optional street address.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

## Usage

Take a look at the specs and you'll see how it works.

## Todo

I wonder if it would be smart to include the funcionality of creating the parcel labels here. Maybe.
